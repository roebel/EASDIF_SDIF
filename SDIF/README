# Introduction

SDIF stands for Sound Description Interchange Format.

The general idea of SDIF is to store information related to signal
processing and specifically of sound, in files, according to a common
format to all data types. Thus, it is possible to store results or
parameters of analyses, syntheses...


# Installation and compilation

Refer to the file INSTALL

# Utilisation

From version 3.3 the library doesn't need the SdifTypes.STYP file any more.

Only if you want to try out experimental description types, you need
to set the environment variable SDIFTYPES to use tools.  SDIFTYPES
must be set to the path of SdifTypes.STYP (file of frames and matrix
types).  By default, this file is in sdif_package_dir/data/

For example, if you put SDIF in joe home directory, to set SDIFTYPES
you must execute:

- if you use bash:
        export SDIFTYPES= /home/joe/SDIF-3.3/data/SdifTypes.STYP

- if you use csh:
        setenv SDIFTYPES /home/joe/SDIF-3.3/data/SdifTypes.STYP


# Documentation

# Large file support

starting from version 3.11.3 sdif files being larger than 2GB are supported on
Mac OS X, Windows, and for all systems using the gcc compiler that support
enabling large file support by means of setting the  compiler macro 
_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64.
