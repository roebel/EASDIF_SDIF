README for SWIG wrapper generation for eaSDIF

------------------------------------------------------------------------------


1. INTRODUCTION

SWIG  generates  extension  modules   for  all  sorts  of  interpreted
languages such as Perl, Python, Tcl, Java, Php, that allow you to call
the eaSDIF and SDIF library functions from these languages.

The extension modules  that can be generated are

- eaSDIF  it contains  high-level classes and is normally
          sufficient for all programming needs.
	  the project files for the eaSDIF module can be created
          using the cmake build system. 
          It should be available on most existing
          compilers and OS.

- SDIF	  with all the C-definitions of the low-level SDIF library 
          (huge, currently commented out!)
	  the SDIF module is only working on linux systems. 
	  Due to its size and low level api it is strongly 
	  suggested to use eaSDIF for scripting languages.

For more info about eaSDIF, the high-level C++ interface to the Ircam 
SDIF library, see http://www.ircam.fr/sdif or send mail to sdif@ircam.fr.

For more info about SWIG, see http://www.swig.org.

2. BUILDING

currently three different languages (python, perl, java) are supported,
by means of copy pasting  the different configuration files in the sub
directories new  bindings for other  languages are easy to  setup. the
configuration has  been tested with  swig 1.3.31, all  earlier version
are not supported and will most likely not work.

The cmake  build configuration  provides configurations for  all three
targets (if the  required libraries and compilers are  avilable on the
system).   The swig  interfaces  are configured  if the  corresponding
cmake option DO_YYY (with YYY set to  PYTHON, PERL, or JAVA) is set to
ON during configuration and build system generation. Multiple swig
interface targets can be enabled at the same time.

Note, the  cmake build  system requires out  of source  building. This
means  your  build  directory  should  be  distinct  from  the  source
directory.

To configure cd into the Easdif build directory (see ../README) and run

> # configuration
> cmake PATH_TO_EASDIF_SRC_DIR -DEASDIF_DO_PYTHON:BOOL=ON 

# build swig interface (example for python)
# assume that the build generator has created 
# standard unix makefiles.

> cd swig/python 
> make
> make check

The Interface file is eaSDIF.py and the bindings to the Easdif library
are in the shared library eaSDIF.so (eaSDIF.dylib, or eaSDIF.dll)

Note, that  other build system configurations than  unix makefiles can
be  selected  by  means  of  the -Gbuildsystem  switch  of  the  cmake
command. For more info on cmake look at www.cmake.org.


GNU autoools configure


If you want to use GNU autotools configuration you are warned that the
autotools configure does not support out of source tree building. Moreover
all but the python modules will build only on Linux systems.


3. DIRECTORY STRUCTURE

easdif/swig		common files
easdif/swig/perl5	language dir for perl5
easdif/swig/python	...
easdif/swig/java
...more later...	(especially hoping for matlab, ruby)


4. SOURCE FILES

4.1 Main Directory

In the main directory, the .i.in files generate the .i files with the
proper paths set, via configure:

CMakeLists.txt		configuration for easdif-swig
easdif-common.i.in	common definitions for the eaSDIF module
easdif-common-init.i	common initializations for the eaSDIF module
sdif-common.i.in	common definitions for the SDIF module
easdif-defines.i	the basic SDIF stuff needed for eaSDIF

4.2 Language Directories

In each language dir, there are these source files:

CMakeLists.txt		cmake build system configuration.
easdif-<lang>.i		main interface file for eaSDIF module definition, 
			(includes ../easdif-common.i)
sdif-<lang>.i		main interface file for SDIF module, 
			(includes ../sdif-common.i)
sdiftypemap-<lang>.i	typemaps for both modules
			(for SdifSignature and SdifStringT)
...test-scripts, etc.


4.3 The Module Definition File

Each <lang>/easdif-<lang>.i has to include ../easdif-common.i and has
to define the initialization of the module, and the class renaming:

	#define SWIG_RENAME_EASDIF

if <lang> does force you to use the eaSDIF qualifier anyway, to avoid
the ugly and redundant eaSDIF::SDIFMatrix().


5. TODO

- finish support for selection functions
- direct set/get of text matrices
- map/tie matrix columns to hash keys with array value
